# Resouce Tuner

Resource Tuner is a lightweight daemon that monitors and dynamically regulates CPU, memory, and I/O usage of user-space processes.
It leverages kernel interfaces like procfs, sysfs and cgroups to enforce runtime policies, ensuring system stability and performance in embedded and resource-constrained environments.
